SOLUTIONS.

A1. No, assigning a value to a string's indexed character does not violate Python's string immutability. String immutability means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. However, assigning a value to an indexed character does not modify the existing string; instead, it creates a new string with the updated character at the specified index.

A2. Using the += operator to concatenate strings does not violate Python's string immutability. The += operator combines the existing string with another string and assigns the result back to the original variable. While it may seem like the original string is being modified, it is actually creating a new string that contains the concatenated values of the original string and the added string.

A3. In Python, there is only one way to index a character in a string. You can use square brackets [] with the index position inside to access an individual character. For example, `string_variable[0]` will retrieve the character at index 0 in the string.

A4. Indexing and slicing are related concepts in Python strings. Indexing refers to accessing a single character at a specific position in a string using its index. Slicing, on the other hand, refers to extracting a substring or a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices. Slicing is done using the colon (:) operator, such as `string_variable[start:end]`, where `start` is the index to start slicing from (inclusive) and `end` is the index to stop slicing (exclusive).

A5. The indexed character in a string has a data type of string of length 1. It is a string because Python represents individual characters as strings. When slicing a string to generate a substring, the resulting data form is also a string.

A6. In Python, strings are made up of individual characters. However, Python does not have a distinct character type like some other programming languages. In Python, characters are represented as strings of length 1. So, the terms "string" and "character" are often used interchangeably.

A7. Two operators that allow you to combine smaller strings to create a larger string are the + operator for concatenation and the * operator for repetition. The + operator concatenates two or more strings, while the * operator repeats a string a specified number of times. Additionally, the `join()` method can be used to combine multiple strings from an iterable into a single string.

A8. The benefit of first checking the target string with `in` or `not in` before using the `index()` method to find a substring is to avoid raising an exception if the substring is not found. When using `index()`, if the substring is not present in the target string, it will raise a `ValueError`. By using `in` or `not in` to check for the presence of the substring beforehand, you can handle the case where the substring is not found without raising an exception.

A9. The operators and built-in string methods that produce simple Boolean (true/false) results include:

- `==` operator: Checks if two strings are equal and returns `True` if they are, `False` otherwise.
- `!=` operator: Checks if two strings are not equal and returns `True` if they are not, `False` otherwise.
- `in` operator: Checks if a substring is present in a string and returns `True` if it is, `False` otherwise.
- `not in` operator: Checks if a substring is not present in a string and returns `True` if it is not, `False` otherwise.
- `startswith()` method: Checks if a string starts with a specified prefix and returns `True` if it does, `False` otherwise.
- `endswith()` method: Checks if a string ends with a specified suffix and returns `True` if it does, `False` otherwise.
